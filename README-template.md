## My process
  I started with HTML using divs to put the content where I wanted so that I could use Flexbox properly. I started by positioning the card in the center of the body, and to divide it in top and bottom. After that I used Flexbox to align the bottom content in the center using flexbox-direction: column. After that, I used flexbox again two times, the first to position the name and location vertically, and the second to position the stats horizontaly. Then, I edited the fonts using the style guide properties given and positioned the circle with the photo inside. The last thing that I did was the two background circles and their position. I tried to make them responsive using media queries but I think that was the part that I had more difficulties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I used for the first time SVG so at first I didnÂ´t know how to apply them but then I asked some developer friends that helped me.
I had some difficulties to proper position the background circles but I think I've done a solid job.


### Continued development

I want to develop the use of media queries to make my projects more responsive.
